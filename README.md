This is the mini facebook or a social app using node microservices.
Here are four services namely identity service responsible for user registration, login and logout,
post services for crud operations for a post,
media services for adding images to a post,
search service for searching functionality .
I have used Redis for caching and message broker using RabbitMQ to communicate between services.
